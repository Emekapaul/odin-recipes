        <ol class="contentcolor">
           <li>Wash assorted(goat) meat thoroughly to get rid of unwanted bits.</li>
           <li>If you are using lungs and liver, Iâ€™ll advise you parboil for 
            about 6 minutes before adding to the rest of the meat or simply 
            cut the meat to cube size to allow easy access when 
            washing to get rid of the clotted blood. rinse clean and 
            continue with the cooking procedures.</li>
            <li>Place a pan containing washed assorted meat on medium heat 
            add chopped onions, garlic, salt, seasoning, half of the 
            pepper soup spice, add enough water to cover the meat and 
            bring to boil for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining pepper soup spice and vegetable oil 
            and reduce the heat. Also, check for salt and seasoning. 
            Add more water to the broth is needed.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, add a handful of scent leaves 
            or basil. I used a combination of dried and fresh basil</li>
            <li>Bring to boil till meat is tender and serve immediately 
            Nigerian pepper soup can be eaten on it own or with 
            agidi (eko) or bread</li>
