        <p class="contentcolor">Chicken Suya made with chicken wings! This popular Nigerian street 
        food recipe is perfect for the summer, entertaining or to just 
        enjoy on a weeknight. The chicken is marinated in Suya spice also 
        known as yaji or Suya pepper and then grilled to perfection with 
        the wings falling off the bones. It is flavourful utterly delicious.</p>

        <p class="contentcolor">Suya spice is a popular marinade used on thinly sliced beef and 
        grilled on open fire until well done. It is mostly made by men 
        called Mallam and served at nights. Over time, the mallam 
        started incorporating other protein such as hen and chicken 
        into the mix. They serve this grilled meat with salad wrapped 
        in old newspapers.</p>

        <h3 class="h">STEPS</h3>

        <ol class="contentcolor">
            <li>Prep the chicken wings! Cut it into drumettes and winglets 
            and pat dry with a kitchen towel and transfer to a bowl</li>
            <li>To the chicken wings, add salt, chicken bouillon powder, 
            suya spice and mix into the wings until well combined. 
            Cover the bowl with clingfilm and leave to marinade in a cool 
            place for at least 30 minutes. The longer you marinade the 
            chicken, the tastier it becomes, so feel free to marinade for
            up to 24 hours in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Whilst the wings is marinating, to a small bowl, add suya 
            spice and vegetable oil and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill or oven at 180C/360F and prepare the 
            baking tray. Line it with an aluminium foil and place 
            a baking rack on it.</li>
            <li>Arrange the chicken wings on the baking rack. Give 
            them enough room so they cook evenly and gets enough 
            air circulation in the oven.</li>
            <li>Brush the chicken with the marinade made earlier and 
            grill/broil or bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Take 
            it out of the oven and flip then rub more of the marinade, 
            return into the oven and continue cooking for another 15 
            minutes. For a final time, bring it out of the oven,
            lip and rub the remaining marinade and grill 
            for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring the chicken wings out of the oven and transfer
            to a bowl, sprinkle more suya spice. Serve with sliced
            onions, tomatoes and any other salad of choice.  Enjoy</li>
